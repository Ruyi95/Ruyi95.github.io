title: Tests with Jupyter Notebook
--- 
I am reading **_Python Data Science Handbook_** by Jake VanderPlas 
recently. This book is shared by the author on his website, and in the form 
of Jupyter Notebook on github. While reading the book, I installed **Jupyter Notebook** on my Fedora system and 
tested out the examples. This process is amazing! I can see why Jupyter Notebook is widely utilized. [My 
notes on NumPy is uploaded here](/NumPy) to test out the `jupyter nbconvert 
--to markdown` function. With Jupyter Notebook, I can get my hands on many projects, 
such as tutorials and example codes. Great appreciation to the author and many other contributors!
