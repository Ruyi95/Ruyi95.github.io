I spent two days building this Github page to present myself and manage HPC learning resources. The simple style is customized from <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima" target="_blank">minima</a> template. It looks really good to me. By building this page with Jekyll, I refreshed my knowledge of Linux, Git, Markdown and HTML/CSS. Also, I learned how to install Ruby, Gem, and Bundler on Fedora.

It's exciting to finish a pilot project, especially when it is a start point for my career. More resources and professional development expierence to be added.
